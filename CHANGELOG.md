# Changelog

## v0.7.7

- feat: `SnowflakeLedgerBackend` accepts a `connection_factory` and self-heals on auth-token expiry (Snowflake errno 390114) — on a detected expiry it obtains a fresh connection, swaps it in, and retries the same statement exactly once. Composes with `client_session_keep_alive` heartbeats as the backstop for residual expiries. Backward compatible: with only `connection`, behavior is unchanged. (#24)
- perf: batch edge resolution in the investigate/graph hot path — `get_models` batch lookup replaces per-edge round trips. (#25)

## v0.7.6

- fix: `SnowflakeLedgerBackend` skips schema DDL (`CREATE SCHEMA`/`CREATE TABLE`/`ALTER`) on write-mode init when the schema + tables already exist (probed via `SELECT`-only `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`). Snowflake checks the `CREATE` privilege even for `IF NOT EXISTS`, so this lets a least-privilege deployment with only `INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT` write without holding schema-ownership-level DDL grants. Fresh deployments still auto-provision; introspection failure falls back to the `CREATE` path. (#26)
- fix: the bulk write path (`_flush_models_pandas`/`_flush_snapshots_pandas`) falls back to the DDL-free SQL `MERGE`/`INSERT` path when the role can't create the temporary staging table (SQLSTATE 42501), instead of failing the write. The entire write path now requires only `INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT`. (#26)
- fix: connector-discovered `status` propagates to the model row on `Ledger.add()` (`metadata['status']` contract, `ModelStatus` enum validation, dedup-skip self-correction). (#23)

## v0.7.4

- perf: `SnowflakeLedgerBackend.composite_summary()` computes the full composite inventory in ONE self-contained SQL statement over MODELS + SNAPSHOTS (CTE-based event replay), replacing the previous delegation to an externally-managed `V_COMPOSITES` view. Removes the undocumented requirement that deployments create that view, and replicates the SDK fallback semantics exactly (membership baseline from `member_of` dependency links + `member_added`/`member_removed` replay with latest-op-wins; distinct-id open-observation set semantics). Measured against a production-scale ledger (28.8k models / 212k snapshots): 92.6s sequential fallback → sub-second warm (~0.3-0.6s).

## v0.7.3

- Add `metadata: dict` field to `ModelRef`. Thread through `register()` and `register_group()`. Replaces the unintended per-link broadcast of `register_group(metadata=...)` to member links; metadata now lives on the composite ModelRef itself. Backward compatible: existing data loads with `metadata={}`.
- Add optional `model_types` parameter to `composite_summary()` so callers can include custom composite-shaped types (e.g., `ml_model`, `heuristic`) beyond the default `"composite"`. Backward compatible.

## Unreleased

- feat: `RecordOutput.model_hash` — the `/record` response now carries the server's canonical model hash so HTTP clients can reconcile their local `ModelRef` with authoritative server state
- fix: `HttpLedgerBackend.save_model` adopts the server's canonical hash (reassigns `model.model_hash` on the incoming `ModelRef` and caches only the server hash) so follow-up hash-based flows like `Ledger.tag()` round-trip correctly even from a fresh backend instance
- feat: `POST /tag` and `GET /tags/{model_name}` REST endpoints — create, move, and list tags over HTTP
- feat: `tag` and `list_tags` MCP tools — bring the total tool count to 8
- feat: `HttpLedgerBackend.set_tag`, `get_tag`, `list_tags` — replace the previous silent no-op stubs with real implementations that round-trip through the REST API
- feat: `TagInput`, `TagOutput`, `TagListOutput` Pydantic schemas
- fix: `HttpLedgerBackend` caches `model_hash` → `model_name` on successful name lookups so `get_model(model_hash)` resolves correctly for models that were resolved by name (previously returned `None` because `ModelSummary` omits `created_at`)
- feat: `prefect_connector()` — discover deployments from Prefect Cloud with optional tag filtering
- feat: `last_seen` timestamp on `ModelRef` — updated every sync run, even for unchanged models
- feat: dual change timestamps — `change_detected` (UTC, always set) and `change_occurred` (from source, optional via `source_updated_at` metadata)
- feat: `register_group()` — register governed model groups with member linking
- feat: `members()` — list all models that belong to a group
- feat: `groups()` — find all groups a model belongs to
- fix: `rest_connector` preserves URL query params (httpx was stripping them when `params={}`)
